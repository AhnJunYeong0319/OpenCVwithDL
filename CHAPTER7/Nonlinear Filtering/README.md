<h1> ‚óè Gaussian Smoothing Filter </h1>

## 1) 1D / 2D Gaussian Distribution
After getting gradient magnitude and direction, a full scan of image is done to remove any unwanted pixels which may not constitute the edge. For this, at every pixel, pixel is checked if it is a local maximum in its neighborhood in the direction of gradient. Check the image below:

Point A is on the edge ( in vertical direction). Gradient direction is normal to the edge. Point B and C are in gradient directions. So point A is checked with point B and C to see if it forms a local maximum. If so, it is considered for next stage, otherwise, it is suppressed ( put to zero).

In short, the result you get is a binary image with "thin edges" (like the figure on the right).

## 2) Consisting Gaussian Smoothing Kernel(Mask)
Each coefficient of kernel(= each element of mask matrix) is set based on Gaussian Distribution above. Also, so as to keep the brightness of the input image the same after smoothing, we should make a sum of kernel(mask) coefficients become '1'. See the matrix below:

After passing convolution process, this filter eventually smooths the image!

```python
import cv2
Blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, ksize, 0)

cv2.imshow("Gaussian Filtering", Blurred)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
